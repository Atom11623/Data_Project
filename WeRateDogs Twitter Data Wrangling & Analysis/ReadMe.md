# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling & Analysis

## Introduction

This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and focuses on analyzing WeRateDogs, a Twitter account known for posting and rating pictures of dogs with humorous and unconventional ratings. The analysis centers on wrangling WeRateDogs's Twitter archive and includes additional data gathered using the Twitter API. The main objectives are to clean and assess the data, conduct an analysis, and answer specific questions related to WeRateDogs's Twitter activity and dog ratings.

### Dogtionary

WeRateDogs classifies dogs into various categories or "stages," including:
- Doggo: A big pupper
- Floofer: Any dog with fur in need of grooming
- Pupper: A small dog
- Puppo: A transitional phase between pupper and doggo

Udacity also used a neural network to predict dog breeds from the images on WeRateDogs's account, providing data on confidence levels for each prediction and whether the prediction is a dog breed.

## Data Wrangling

The data wrangling process focuses on original WeRateDogs tweets that have ratings and images. It involves cleaning the data and making it suitable for analysis. The process includes data gathering, assessment, and cleaning.

## Analysis

The analysis aims to address several questions, including:
- WeRateDogs's posting trend by month
- Monthly trend of interactions with WeRateDogs's posts
