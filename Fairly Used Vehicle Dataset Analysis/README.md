## Summary of Findings

After thorough exploration, several key insights were discovered:

- The price of a vehicle in Nigeria is significantly influenced by factors like engine cylinder count, fuel type, and transmission type.
- Vehicles with higher odometer readings tend to be less expensive compared to those with lower readings, indicating a negative correlation between price and odometer.
- Commercial vehicles using diesel as a fuel type exhibit a weaker correlation with odometer readings.

## Key Presentation Insights

In the presentation, the following key points will be highlighted:

1. Introduction to Price Variable.
2. Analysis of Price and Odometer Distribution Patterns.
3. Transformed Scatterplots to illustrate correlations.
4. Detailed examination of categorical variables (engine, fuel, transmission, and imported status) using various visualization techniques.

## Additional Information

Nigeria holds the distinction of being the African country with the highest importation of used vehicles from the United States, ranking third globally. According to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), between 2015 and 2018, 14 million light-duty vehicles were exported to low and middle-income countries, with 40% ending up in Africa.

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the price of a motor vehicle in Nigeria is influenced by various factors including engine specifications, fuel type, transmission type, and whether the vehicle is imported or locally used. Additionally, there exists a negative correlation between vehicle price and odometer readings, indicating that vehicles with higher mileage tend to be less expensive. Notably, commercial vehicles using diesel as a fuel type show a weaker correlation with odometer readings.
