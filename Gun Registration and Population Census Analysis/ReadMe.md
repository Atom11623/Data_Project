# Gun Registration and Population Census Analysis

## Introduction

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is utilized to verify the eligibility of prospective firearm or explosive buyers. The system is employed by gun shops to ensure that customers do not possess a criminal record or are otherwise ineligible for purchase. The dataset has been augmented with state-level data from the census.

## Questions

1. What is the trend of total gun registrations over time?
2. What is the overall trend of gun purchases over time?
3. Which year has the highest number of registered guns?
4. Which months have the highest number of registered guns?
5. Which state has the highest number of registered guns?
6. What is the overall trend of purchased gun types over time?
7. What is the most purchased gun type between 1997 and 2010?
8. What is the most purchased gun type between 2011 and 2017?
9. What is the rate of handgun ownership in each state?
10. What is the rate of long gun ownership in each state?
11. Which census data is most associated with high gun per capita?

## Dataset Information

The dataset consists of 12,485 entries with 27 columns, including information on permits, handguns, long guns, and various other gun-related variables. The dataset also includes state-level data on gun ownership.

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis, several key findings have been observed:

- The majority of gun registrations per month do not exceed 100,000.
- Gun registrations have shown a significant increase over time, with 2016 having the highest number of registrations followed by 2017.
- December is the month with the highest number of gun registrations.
- The top 10 states with the highest number of gun registrations are Kentucky, Texas, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Indiana, and Tennessee.
- Long guns are the most purchased gun type between 1997 and 2010, while handguns are the most purchased type after 2010.
- The 2016 population census data is most associated with high gun per capita, with a rate of 0.708%, compared to the 2010 population census data with a rate of 0.387%.
- There is a positive correlation between the number of registered guns and population census.

## Data Limitations

It is important to note some limitations in the analysis:

- Outliers were observed in the Kentucky and Illinois data.
- Illinois, despite having strict gun control measures, showed high gun registration.
- There is missing state-level data in the population census dataset.

For further analysis, it is recommended to investigate and address these limitations.
